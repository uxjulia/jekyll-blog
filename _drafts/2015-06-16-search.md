title: The Most Inefficient Way to Build a Search Query, Ever?

I'm not a developer, but I'd like to think that I'm a fairly logical person. I'm also not completely foreign to the concept of writing search queries. So, I don't think I'm completely in the wrong when I look at the following code for an Advanced Search we're trying to implement and think that it's the most inefficient way of going about it. 

I obviously rewrote this into generic terms, but this is how the search is currently being written. Keep in mind that there are about 15 or so database fields that the user will eventually be searching on, with the ability to do so in any combination they feel suits them. The developer knew this going in, or so I thought.


    if theRequiredInput {
      if (thisCriteria is selected) {
		  then query: thisDatabaseDate that is greater than currentDate;
		  and set aFlag;
	   }
      if aFlag is set
		  then add this to the query: “ and ”;
      if thisOtherCrtieria is selected {
          then query: thisDatabaseField that isLike theRequiredInput;
      } else {
          query: thisDatabaseField that matches theRequiredInput

      } else if (thisInputDate || thisOtherInputDate is not empty) {
          if thisInputDate is notEmpty {
              then query: thisOtherDatabaseDate that matches thisInputDate
              and set aFlag;
          }
          if thisOtherInputDate is notEmpty {
              if aFlag is set 
                  then add this to the query: "AND thisDatabaseDate that matches thisOtherInputDate"
              else
                  query: thisDatabaseDate that matches thisOtherInputDate
          }

      } else if anotherInput {
          if (thisCriteria is selected) {
              then query: thisDatabaseDate is greater than currentDate;
          then query: thisOtherDatabaseField that isLike anotherInput
      }

      final searchCriteria = query

      return someResults
