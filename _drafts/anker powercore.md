#Anker PowerCore 10400
I've used many external batteries and rely on them heavily when I don't want to be attached to an outlet. For an external battery that packs greater than 10,000 mAh of power, it comes in a very compact size. The PowerCore is pocketable, making it even more convenient to take on the go. I have a first gen Astro E3 (also made by Anker) that is 10,000 mAh and the PowerCore is about 2/3 its length, but slightly thicker. I'm totally okay with living with the added thickness in exchange for being able to cleanly slip the battery pack into a back pocket. 

The PowerCore charges devices at a max speed of up to 3 amps-- that's enough power output to charge an iPad and an iPhone at the same time, which is handy on a long road trip or a day spent out and about. A feature that the PowerCore has that I haven't seen in other external battery packs is that it charges devices the moment you plug it in. With most other external battery packs, you have to first push a button to start the charging process. It doesn't sound like too big of a deal, but there have been many times where that simple push of a button has been overlooked and devices were left uncharged, so this feature is greatly appreciated. 

Given the fact that this little guy packs 10,400 mAh of power, it will take a long time to recharge so leaving it overnight to charge up is the best way to go. It's definitely not something you want to leave to charge up at the last minute before a trip.
