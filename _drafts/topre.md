I recently bought the Leopold FC660C, a uniform 45g weighted keyboard outfitted with Topre switches. I also bought the Topre Realforce 87u uniform 55g weighted keyboard to compare the two. The 55g Realforce seems to be a fan favorite among Topre fanatics and I knew I wouldn't be fully satisfied with the purchase of any single board until I could try the other. I can certainly feel the difference in resistance between the two, but I concede that only a true keyboard geek would *really* notice. And only a keyboard fanatic would probably deem the weight difference great enough to justify a separate purchase.

Between the two, the Leopold's keycaps would clack on release that detracted from the overall feel of the keyboard. The Realforce, on the other hand, was like a stealthy ninja in comparison. Even when swapping keycaps between the two, the “clack” wasn’t as pronounced on the Topre board, an apparent testimony of its build quality.  Having just purchased a pack of orthodontic bands to silence the boards, I decided to put them on the clackier Leopold.

Having now silenced it, I can say that I much prefer the sound of a silenced Topre switch. The infamous Topre sound is 1000% more satisfying-- a nice THOCK with no clack. In addition, there is no noticeable change in key travel when using the orthodontic bands, so you still retain all of the Topre goodness.

In my opinion, the silenced Leopold 45g feels very close to the Realforce 87u 55g in terms of resistance but the 87u’s keys do have a unique “bounce back” quality to it that the Leopold’s 45g dome lacks. For that reason, I still use both boards interchangeably. I honestly didn’t think that the Topre switches were all that great when I first got my boards, but having used them as my main board for the past month, they really do grow on you. There’s just something so very satisfying about typing on them.
