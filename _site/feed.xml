        <title>Using Draftin for Version Control</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m frequently asked to proofread people’s writing, whether it be a resume, an essay or an email. While there is software out there that comes with change tracking, they don’t incorporate it with version control and collaboration in a way that’s easy to use and straightforward enough for the less than tech-savvy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A while back, I had scoured the internet for a “GitHub” for writers. Basically a tool that would give me version control, allow multiple people to collaborate at once, easily distinguish any changes that were made and subsequently reject or accept those changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The solution that I found was in the form of a website: &lt;img src=&quot;http://www.draftin.com&quot; alt=&quot;draftin.com&quot;&gt;. It’s a barebones site with very little fluff and gets right to the point. You can start your writing project right there, or paste in writing from an outside source. It keeps track of all your changes and allows you to share your writing for feedback or, like in my case, share the edits you’ve made to someone else’s writing. It’s completely free to use but if you like the service, you can donate by buying a monthly or yearly subscription to help maintain the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The great thing is that all of the change tracking features work even if everything was done outside of the website. For example, I had already made all my edits to an essay but wanted to be able to share exactly where those edits were with another person. So I pasted in the original text into DraftIn and saved that as a draft. Then I went in and pasted over all of that text with my edited text. When I share the link, it highlights all of my changes right alongside the original text with an option to accept or reject. &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Clamcase Pro for iPad Mini</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;So I did it. I went and bought the Clamcase Pro for iPad Mini. I had been looking at it for the past few days. Maybe it was only a day... Whatever, it felt like days. And, of course, the cookies in my browser allowed Clamcase to target ads towards me from that point on, never letting me forget that I once contemplated their product for purchase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried to stay away, researching alternatives and asking myself, &amp;quot;Do I truly need a keyboard that costs 1/3 of the price of the device it is attaching itself to?&amp;quot;I tried to stay away, but the beautifully designed keyboard, high-res product photos and those damn targeted ads just kept pulling me back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, the Clamcase website offered me a coupon code for signing up for their newsletter, which would bring down the cost by $20. The temptation to purchase had never been higher. I decided to look up some video reviews to see how it looks in motion and to get a better size comparison. Or perhaps I just wanted a little bit more of a nudge to convince myself that I should buy it. In any case, after a few videos I decided to go for it. If I&amp;#39;m gonna get another keyboard, I&amp;#39;m gonna get one of the best ones out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I now await its arrival, which should be within the next 3-5 days. Today though, another keyboard splurge of mine arrives. The CODE Mechanical Keyboard. I don&amp;#39;t know how it happened, but suddenly I&amp;#39;m a keyboard enthusiast.&lt;/p&gt;
