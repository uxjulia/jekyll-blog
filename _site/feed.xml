        <title>Brackets Text Editor</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been using Brackets to make HTML and CSS changes to my blog and I&amp;#39;m finding that I&amp;#39;m liking it more and more each day. It falls into the same family of text editors such as Sublime, Atom and TextMate. If you&amp;#39;re familiar with those then you&amp;#39;ll know exactly the market segment Brackets is geared for. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was on the fence about whether I wanted to use Atom (founded by GitHub) or Brackets (founded by Adobe) as my text editor of choice when customizing my Jekyll blog, which was created by GitHub co-founder Tom Werner-Preston. Even though Atom was founded by GitHub, Brackets was the one to win a home on my dock. It&amp;#39;s easy to use from the get-go, especially for someone that&amp;#39;s more accustomed to WYSIWYG editors than text editors. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was able to download a Git extension and connect to my &lt;del&gt;GitHub&lt;/del&gt; BitBucket[^1] account to make commits and git push directly from Brackets without a hitch. I wasn&amp;#39;t able to figure it out as easily with Atom. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite features of Bracket is the ability to preview CSS Hex colors and images by hovering over the code. You can tell from the little things that Brackets is a text editor designed with the designer in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[^1] I&amp;#39;ve since changed my workflow to BitBucket + Wercker + Amazon S3 + CloudFront.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Apple Watch App Sucks</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Questions for the developers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why can&amp;#39;t I uninstall / disable an app from the &amp;quot;App Layout&amp;quot; menu?&lt;/strong&gt;
This is the equivalent to the iPhone’s “Home” screen and yet it doesn’t follow the same removal logic. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is there no indication whether or not an app is installed / enabled on my watch from the list of available apps?&lt;/strong&gt;
The only way to know whether an app is installed is by going to the “home” screen, which leads to my next question…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why are the list of enabled apps and the option to disable them in two different locations?&lt;/strong&gt;
WHY!?!?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Apple Watch</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;So the first batch of Apple Watches were shipped out this week and I just got mine today. I promptly put it on, adjusted the settings and installed my apps that have a Watch counterpart. For the most part, the size of the Watch makes many apps pretty useless in my opinion. The only apps that truly seem to have any use are the reference apps like weather, calendar or apps that allow remote control like Apple Remote, music control&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;www.knocktounlock.com&quot;&gt;Knock&lt;/a&gt;. Everything else is just too difficult to really be useful on such a tiny screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve only had the watch for a few hours now but I can list a few things so far that I like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heartbeat monitor&lt;/strong&gt;: I&amp;#39;ve always wanted an activity monitor that had a built in heartbeat monitor, and now I have one!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Raised wrist detection&lt;/strong&gt;: The motion sensor has been working flawlessly to display the watch face when I raise my wrist.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iPhone Camera control functionality&lt;/strong&gt;: There is pretty visible latency between the watch and iPhone&amp;#39;s camera display, but this will come in handy as a remote should the need ever arise. Hopefully a software update in the future will improve this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple TV Remote&lt;/strong&gt; This will certainly come in handy when I&amp;#39;m too lazy to get up to find the actual remote. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Sport band&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;#39;ve had way more activity monitors that came with a similar &amp;quot;sport&amp;quot; band, but none are as luxurious as Apple&amp;#39;s. I have fairly small wrists but this band fits me perfectly, with a couple of notches left over. I also really like how the end of the band tucks in so that it won&amp;#39;t catch onto anything when you&amp;#39;re out doing sporty things with your sport band. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why hasn&amp;#39;t Spotify released an Apple Watch app yet?&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref1&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Version Control With Draftin</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m frequently asked to proofread people’s writing, whether it be a resume, an essay or an email. While there is software out there that comes with change tracking, they don’t incorporate it with version control and collaboration in a way that’s easy to use and straightforward enough for the less than tech-savvy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A while back, I had scoured the internet for a “GitHub” for writers. Basically a tool that would give me version control, allow multiple people to collaborate at once, easily distinguish any changes that were made and subsequently reject or accept those changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The solution that I found was in the form of a website: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.draftin.com&quot;&gt;draftin.com&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a barebones site with very little fluff and gets right to the point. You can start your writing project right there, or paste in writing from an outside source. It keeps track of all your changes and allows you to share your writing for feedback or, like in my case, share the edits you’ve made to someone else’s writing. It’s completely free to use but if you like the service, you can donate by buying a monthly or yearly subscription to help maintain the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The great thing is that all of the change tracking features work even if everything was done outside of the website. For example, I had already made all my edits to an essay but wanted to be able to share exactly where those edits were with another person. So I pasted in the original text into DraftIn and saved that as a draft. Then I went in and pasted over all of that text with my edited text. When I share the link, it highlights all of my changes right alongside the original text with an option to accept or reject. &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Clamcase Pro for iPad Mini</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;So I did it. I went and bought the Clamcase Pro for iPad Mini. I had been looking at it for the past few days. Maybe it was only a day... Whatever, it felt like days. And, of course, the cookies in my browser allowed Clamcase to target ads towards me from that point on, never letting me forget that I once contemplated their product for purchase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried to stay away, researching alternatives and asking myself, &amp;quot;Do I truly need a keyboard that costs 1/3 of the price of the device it is attaching itself to?&amp;quot;I tried to stay away, but the beautifully designed keyboard, high-res product photos and those damn targeted ads just kept pulling me back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, the Clamcase website offered me a coupon code for signing up for their newsletter, which would bring down the cost by $20. The temptation to purchase had never been higher. I decided to look up some video reviews to see how it looks in motion and to get a better size comparison. Or perhaps I just wanted a little bit more of a nudge to convince myself that I should buy it. In any case, after a few videos I decided to go for it. If I&amp;#39;m gonna get another keyboard, I&amp;#39;m gonna get one of the best ones out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I now await its arrival, which should be within the next 3-5 days. Today though, another keyboard splurge of mine arrives. The CODE Mechanical Keyboard. I don&amp;#39;t know how it happened, but suddenly I&amp;#39;m a keyboard enthusiast.&lt;/p&gt;
