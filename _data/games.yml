#  comment: "Many of you may be familiar with 2048. Threes is the original that they ripped off of (and the way better version) that requires more strategy and skill to get a high score. I've been a fan of this game for awhile now, but they've recently released a free version so go and download it! It's even been ported to the web!"

  comment: "If you enjoy games similar to Sim Tower, you'll enjoy Fallout Shelter. The goal is to keep your dwellers safe and happy, prevent disasters like raider attacks and fires while building a vault that uses resources efficiently."
