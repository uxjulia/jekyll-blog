So about a month and a half ago, I decided to purchase my first mechanical keyboard. I had wanted one a few years back, but had totally forgot about them. But now, I am fully immersed in them. They’ve become a bit of an obsession and the dive in it was immediate and head first. 

A month and a half after my initial purchase and I’ve found I’ve already amassed four keyboards, a switch tester, 3 replacement keycap sets, and two bluetooth keyboard adapters. The insanity needs to stop. 

### The keyboards (in order of purchase)

1. [CODE 104 Key - Clear Cherry MX](http://amzn.to/1GvYE6v)
2. [KB Paradise V60 - Blue Cherry MX](http://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_detail&p=877)
3. [Vortex POK3R - Blue Cherry MX](http://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_detail&p=1237)
4. [Leopold FC660C - Topre 45g](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Leopold-FC660C-Electrostatic-Capacitive-Topre-Switch-Keyboard-Blank-Keycap-PBT-/271838272873?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item3f4ad2dd69)

I don’t want to get into an in-depth review on the keyboards just yet, those will be for another post. But I do just want to give a brief commentary on each. 

#### Leopold FC660C
I definitely hear the distinctive “THOCK” that people use to describe the sound a Topre board produces. It *is* pretty gratifying. To me the switch feels like a mix of a Red and Clear Cherry MX. Take the tactile bump and the actuation point of the Clear, move them up to the top and merge that with the linear switch of a Red Cherry MX and you've got yourself a Topre switch.

#### Vortex POK3R
For its relatively low price, I like that it comes with a premium aluminum base and PBT keycaps standard. The combination gives the board a very premium feel. The 3 layer custom fn-layer programming is nice but I wish there was a dip switch to swap the Windows and Alt keys to make it Mac friendly. Not too big of a deal though since I use Karabiner to remap the keys.

#### KB Paradise V60
The interchangeable LEDs are a nice touch, the ABS keycaps suck. The fn-layer layout is thoughtfully placed.

#### CODE
The white LEDs are nice. This is the only full size keyboard I bought because I do like my numpad, but I felt one full-size board was enough. The board has a very apparent ping upon upstroke of the stock ABS keys. It's insanely annoying and makes the board <s>feel</s> sound cheap. Replacing the ABS keys with PBT keys has reduced this.
