##### Disclaimer : I am not a boxing aficionado, nor do I claim to be. I readily admit that I am a bandwagon boxing “fan” and only watch enough to form a biased opinion. The following is based on that biased opinion. (As is everything else on this site).

When it comes to celebrities, athletes, and public figures their image is well crafted[^1] by a team of publicists, managers, promoters and the like. We see what they want us to see.[^2] Our limited view is the public-facing life they are willing to put out there. We regular-folk do this too. Just visit anyone’s Facebook, LinkedIn, or Instagram account. 

Having said that, I can only assume Floyd Mayweather's cocky, pompous, asshole-y persona is intentional. It can either be an intentional image for publicity's sake or an intentional reflection of his true self. Either way, it appears he wants to be seen as a douchebag and I am more than happy to oblige. 

Let's put aside the debate about whether he is "pound for pound, the best boxer in the world" and just all agree that Floyd "Money" Mayweather is a pompous asshole. His self-given nickname is evident enough. 

Strip away everything that makes him famous and leave him with the image he has made for himself and I bet even his fans wouldn't be friends with him. Hey, it's entirely possible that outside of the ring and away from the cameras he's a totally nice guy... full of humility and appreciation for the little things in life. 

Or, maybe he's still just a douchebag.

[^1]:	But not necessarily crafted well.
[^2]:	Until the paparazzi get involved and we start getting a glimpse at their private life and are shocked. *SHOCKED*.
