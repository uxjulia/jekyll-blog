The Post-it is a familiar and unassuming product found in practically any office you step into.  They’re not just great for jotting down quick reminders, they’re also a really handy paper prototyping tool. When conducting ad-hoc UX sessions with subject-matter experts to gather feedback, I’ve found the Post-it to be indispensable. 

They're likely already in the office, they stick to practically any available surface and can easily be moved around or tossed. Their small size forces you to keep it simple, something I've found I can lose sight of when working with software like Justinmind Prototyper or Balsamiq Mockups.  

I use the standard  3" x 3" post-it as well as the index card sized ones that are 4" x 6". Using these, I can sketch out UI elements like text inputs, dropdown menus etc., stick them to a wall or whiteboard and quickly gather feedback. The low-fidelity helps keep the discussion on the abstract: workflows, requirements and user needs rather than on aesthetics. It also communicates to the participant that we’re in the planning stage, that nothing is set in stone and any ideas or suggestions they have are welcome.
