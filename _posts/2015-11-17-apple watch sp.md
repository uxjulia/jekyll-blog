I’m not sure the sapphire glass display of the Apple Watch really warrants a screen protector, I've been wearing my watch without any protection since launch and it's been fine. If you have the Apple Watch Sport version with the ionized glass display, it *might* make more sense, but I decided to try one out for myself anyways since I got the opportunity to test one. 

When I took the screen protector out of its packaging, I was shocked to see how small it was. I understand that the curved display places a limit on how much the screen protector can cover but I wasn’t really expecting the screen protector to be *that* small. I guess I never realized at what point the screen began to curve and this product definitely drew attention to that. It actually looks a bit ridiculous since so much of the screen’s edge is still left exposed to potential damage and detracts from the watch face. For what it does protect though, it does it fairly well. I saw no reduction in clarity or touch sensitivity while it was on. 

Since the protector is so minuscule, placing it onto the watch and avoiding the curved edges takes surgeon-like skills. I don’t have large hands by any standard, but I felt like I was playing a game of [Operation] the whole time. Honestly, I hate how it looks so much that I’d rather take my chances with the sapphire crystal display than leave it on.
