So I did it. I went and bought the Clamcase Pro for iPad Mini. I had been looking at it for the past few days. Maybe it was only a day... Whatever, it felt like days. And, of course, the cookies in my browser allowed Clamcase to target ads towards me from that point on, never letting me forget that I once contemplated their product for purchase.

I tried to stay away, researching alternatives and asking myself, "Do I truly need a keyboard that costs 1/3 of the price of the device it is attaching itself to?"I tried to stay away, but the beautifully designed keyboard, high-res product photos and those damn targeted ads just kept pulling me back.

Eventually, the Clamcase website offered me a coupon code for signing up for their newsletter, which would bring down the cost by $20. The temptation to purchase had never been higher. I decided to look up some video reviews to see how it looks in motion and to get a better size comparison. Or perhaps I just wanted a little bit more of a nudge to convince myself that I should buy it. In any case, after a few videos I decided to go for it. If I'm gonna get another keyboard, I'm gonna get one of the best ones out there.

I now await its arrival, which should be within the next 3-5 days. Today though, another keyboard splurge of mine arrives. The CODE Mechanical Keyboard. I don't know how it happened, but suddenly I'm a keyboard enthusiast.
