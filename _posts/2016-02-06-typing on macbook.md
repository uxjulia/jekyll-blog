# How much do I hate the Macbook’s keyboard?

I’ve had the 12” Macbook for about 2 weeks now and I’ve been doing my best to use its keyboard instead of any of my mechanical keyboards in hopes of training my fingers to adapt to the new design. In hopes of training my fingers to adapt to its keyboard, I’ve forgone the use of my mechanical keyboards.[^1] 

The new butterfly mechanism in the keyboard design allows a super slim keyboard to compliment the razor thin Macbook. I’m sure the engineering and design chops required to get it all done are impressive. The tactile feedback on the keyboard, not as impressive. I realize that many people actually enjoy the keyboard, embracing the shallow travel distance and the reduction of space between individual keys. But to me, the keyboard often feels like I’m typing on a completely flat surface. There is very little distinction between the keys due to the minimal spacing. Combine that with the near zero tactile feedback and it almost feels like I’m typing on a completely flat surface. I don’t know about you, but I can’t stand typing on an iPad’s on-screen keyboard, which is why I always buy a keyboard case of some sort for my iPads.

Some people say that the low profile and tiny travel distance allows them to type faster, and I can certainly see this happening. *Sometimes* I experience this myself after typing on it for an extended period of time. I’m sure if I used the Macbook’s keyboard exclusively, I would eventually adapt and all would be fine. But c’mon. Let’s be real. I have 6 mechanical keyboards on or around my desk right now and I’m constantly fighting the urge to purchase more. The Macbook’s keyboard and I will have a rendezvous here and there, but we’ll never be exclusive. 

I must say though, my bitter hatred for the Macbook’s keyboard always reaches it’s peak right after I’ve come from using one of my mechanical keyboards. Knowing this, I mentally prepare myself for the tactile letdown that will ensue once I reach for the Macbook. Doing this has reduced some of my vitriol towards the flat slab that is a keyboard since I know what I’m about to willingly subject myself to. The time it takes for my fingers to acclimate to the keyboard has shortened with increased usage and I’m hoping one day I won’t completely hate the thing. I think that as time passes, I do in fact hate it less and less. But I don’t know if I’ll ever actually like it more than it’s predecessors, like the one that currently resides on my 2014 15” Retina Macbook Pro. 

Update (2/6/2016): I originally wrote this in November and my sentiments about the Macbook’s keyboard remains the same. Still hate it. The part of me that yearns for tactile feedback weeps as I type on it.
