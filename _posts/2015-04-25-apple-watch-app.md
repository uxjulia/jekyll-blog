Questions for the developers:

**Why can't I uninstall / disable an app from the "App Layout" menu?**
This is the equivalent to the iPhone’s “Home” screen and yet it doesn’t follow the same removal logic. 

**Why is there no indication whether or not an app is installed / enabled on my watch from the list of available apps?**
The only way to know whether an app is installed is by going to the “home” screen, which leads to my next question…

**Why are the list of enabled apps and the option to disable them in two different locations?**
WHY!?!?
