I stumbled across Middleman last night and decided it'd be an interesting framework to learn. Since it's so simliar to Jekyll, I figure it wouldn't be too much of a learning curve. I'm already using Jekyll as more than just a simple blogging platform with some other projects so I figure it'd be a useful framework to have in my arsenal.
