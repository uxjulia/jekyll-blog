tagline: Something new to learn

I stumbled across Middleman last night and decided it'd be an interesting framework to learn. Since it's so simliar to Jekyll, I figure it won't be too much of a learning curve. I'm currently using Jekyll as more than a simple blogging platform for another personal project and since Middleman has the chops to handle more complex websites, I'm eager to get my hands dirty.
