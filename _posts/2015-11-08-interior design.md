I've been really into HGTV lately, watching shows like: House Hunters, Flip or Flop, Love it or List it, Tiny House Hunters, Property Brothers, and Fixer Upper. Watching these shows makes me realize I have zero interior design skills. These shows are great sources of inspiration, but going from inspiration to successful implementation is a lot harder than they make it look on TV. Somehow when I try to make a space look as if some thought was put into it's decor, it still feels sparse and not quite put together. 

But I think I know what the culprit is. As with most things design-related, it's all in the details. And when it comes to interior design, the details are those knick knacks that really pull a room together like the lighting, wall art and random art decor. I'll readily admit that I'm not the greatest when it comes to picking out these little things to compliment a room. What I end up with are the larger staple furniture pieces in a room that lacks warmth or character. 

I envy the people that can look at something that would otherwise look like trash, but to them it's a rustic lampshade or a unique wall center piece. Or those people that can take a bunch of furniture of different styles and colors and make it actually work within the same room, invoking "oohs" and "ahhs" as we marvel in their genius. If I tried to do the same, it would just look like I simply bought what I could afford at a garage sale and then threw them into the room. Blindly.
