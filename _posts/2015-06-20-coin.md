I finally got an email with my Coin’s tracking number! For those of you who don’t know what a <a href="http://www.onlycoin.com">Coin</a> is, it’s basically a credit card to replace your credit cards.

I placed my preorder with them on 12/1/2013 with an estimated delivery date of Spring 2014. The company was clearly overreaching when they set that goal. They’ve had various missteps along the way, from misleading “Claim your Coin” emails and a “Coin Beta” program that got people’s hopes up only to let them down. But the time has **finally** arrived and I’m excited to be able to get my hands on it.
