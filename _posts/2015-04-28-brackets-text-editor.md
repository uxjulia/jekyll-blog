title: Brackets Text Editor
---
I've been using Brackets to make HTML and CSS changes to my blog and I'm finding that I'm liking it more and more each day. It falls into the same family of text editors such as Sublime, Atom and TextMate. If you're familiar with those then you'll know exactly the market segment Brackets is geared for. 

I was on the fence about whether I wanted to use Atom (founded by GitHub) or Brackets (founded by Adobe) as my text editor of choice when customizing my Jekyll blog, which was created by GitHub co-founder Tom Werner-Preston. Even though Atom was founded by GitHub, Brackets was the one to win a home on my dock. It's easy to use from the get-go, especially for someone that's more accustomed to WYSIWYG editors than text editors. 

I was able to download a Git extension and connect to my ~~GitHub~~ BitBucket[^1] account to make commits and git push directly from Brackets without a hitch. I wasn't able to figure it out as easily with Atom. 

One of my favorite features of Bracket is the ability to preview CSS Hex colors and images by hovering over the code. You can tell from the little things that Brackets is a text editor designed with the designer in mind.
