I bought Ulysses because of all the great reviews out there so my expectations coming into this were high. I simultaneously bought it for my Mac and dove in, even going so far as actually reading through the entire tutorial. 

While I do find the writing experience good and the organizational structure helpful, I  feel it's slightly overhyped, the biggest painpoint for me thus fur (and I'm sure for many others as well) has been the complete uselessness of iCloud Sync. 

I've read comments from others that try to defend The Soulmen by saying that it's an Apple issue, an inherent flaw in iCloud. 

But I beg to differ. 

I've never experienced such a disastrous implementation of iCloud Sync before. Where other apps may experience delayed sync or even require a forced sync, Ulysses just falls flat on its face. Not only do my documents never sync, there is not even an option to force a sync. So, when things don't sync I'm left twiddling my thumbs waiting for an event that may never come. 

And of all the apps to not properly sync, a writing app is probably one of the last ones you'd want to have this issue be affected by. For instance, if I started a draft on my computer and took my iPad out for the day in hopes of editing that draft while at a coffee shop, I would be gravely disappointed.  Sure, if I only write on my iPad or Mac and never needed the sync, Ulysses would be a great tool. But I shouldn't have to decide between one or the other when I've already spent the money on both.
