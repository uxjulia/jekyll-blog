So the first batch of Apple Watches were shipped out this week and I just got mine today. I promptly put it on, adjusted the settings and installed my apps that have a Watch counterpart. For the most part, the size of the Watch makes many apps pretty useless in my opinion. The only apps that truly seem to have any use are the reference apps like weather, calendar or apps that allow remote control like Apple Remote, music control[^1] or [Knock](www.knocktounlock.com). Everything else is just too difficult to really be useful on such a tiny screen.

I've only had the watch for a few hours now but I can list a few things so far that I like:

- **Heartbeat monitor**: I've always wanted an activity monitor that had a built in heartbeat monitor, and now I have one!
- **Raised wrist detection**: The motion sensor has been working flawlessly to display the watch face when I raise my wrist.
- **iPhone Camera control functionality**: There is pretty visible latency between the watch and iPhone's camera display, but this will come in handy as a remote should the need ever arise. Hopefully a software update in the future will improve this.
- **Apple TV Remote** This will certainly come in handy when I'm too lazy to get up to find the actual remote. 
- **The Sport band** I've had way more activity monitors that came with a similar "sport" band, but none are as luxurious as Apple's. I have fairly small wrists but this band fits me perfectly, with a couple of notches left over. I also really like how the end of the band tucks in so that it won't catch onto anything when you're out doing sporty things with your sport band.
